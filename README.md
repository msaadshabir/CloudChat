- Interactions: like, retweet, and comment (inline)
- Search: list users and filter by query
- Activity: see likes given/received
- Profile: name/@handle, bio, profile image upload (compressed, Vercel Blob storage)
- Onboarding: collect display name and optional bio/picture; handle via Clerk
- Moderation: configurable banned words for posts/replies
- Admin: delete user or a specific cloud via API
- Production-safe: runtime migrations ensure required tables/columns/indexes exist
